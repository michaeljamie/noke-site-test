                        <p>We strongly recommend that you do not use the Service on a mobile device that has a “jail broken” or “rooted” operating system as this can potentially allow other applications to circumvent security features on your mobile device. Any use of such mobile devices is at your own risk. You agree that Nokē will not be liable for any loss of functionality and will indemnify us for all damage or liability caused by such use.</p>
                        <p>Although we’re not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Service or to review or edit any Content, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure compliance with these Terms, or to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove or disable access the Service or any Content therein, at any time and without notice, including, but not limited to, if we, at our sole discretion, consider any Content to be objectionable or in violation of these Terms.

                        <h3>Feedback</h3>

                        <h3>Termination and Service Changes </h3>
                        <p>These Terms remain in effect as long as you continue to use the Services. You can stop using our Services any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your use of the Services or your access to the Site at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Services. We may also change or remove at any time any features currently offered as part of the Services, or the Services themselves. Upon termination, your account and right to use the Services will automatically terminate. </p>
                        <p>If you transfer your Device to a new owner, please note that your account is not transferable, and the new owner will have to register for a separate account in order to use the Services.</p>
                        <h3>Limitations</h3>
                        <p>Our aim is to make the Services highly reliable and available; however, they may not be available all of the time. The Services are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond Nokē’s control, including without limitation, your Wi-Fi and mobile network failures and coverage limitations, service provider uptime, and acts of god. Further, our Services rely on or interoperate with a number of third party products and services. These third party products and services are beyond Nokē’s control (including without the internet generally and third party service providers that we use for networking and storage), but their operation may impact or be impacted by the use and reliability of our Services. These third party products and services may not operate in a reliable manner all of the time, and they may impact the way that the Services operate, and Nokē is not responsible for damages and losses due to the operation of these third party products and services. You acknowledge these limitations and agree that Nokē is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of the Services to reflect current status or notifications. Further, the Devices and Services are not an emergency notification system, and should not be used in this way.</p>
                        <p>You are responsible for all charges and fees required for your products and applicable services, and for compliance with all applicable agreements, terms of use/service, and other policies of your product and service providers (including internet service providers and mobile device carriers).</p>
                        <p>To the fullest extent allowed by law, Nokē is not responsible for damage or liability caused by (i) use of the Device and Services for purposes other than for which the Device and Services are designed or intended, or use in improper temperature, humidity or other environmental conditions, or use of the Device or Services in violation of written instructions provided by Nokē (which may be provided at the time of purchase or on its website), (ii) normal wear and tear or aging, or improper repair, operation or maintenance or connections to improper voltage supply or, to the extent allowed by law, attempted repair by anyone other than a facility authorized by Nokē to service your Nokē Device.</p>

                        <p>Our employees are not authorized to vary these Terms. These Terms may be modified only (a) by obtaining our written consent in an agreement signed by an officer of Nokē; or (b) as set forth below in the immediately following paragraph.</p>
                        <p>You agree that Nokē may modify these Terms from time to time, and that your right to access the Services is conditioned on an ongoing basis with your compliance with the then-current version of these Terms. We will notify you when we make material revisions or modifications to these Terms by (x) posting a notice or new version of these Terms on the Site, or (y) providing direct notice in a communication to your customer account (if you have one), or otherwise in some manner through the Service that we deem reasonably likely to reach you (which may be by posting to this Site).
